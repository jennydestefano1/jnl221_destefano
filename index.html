		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>

		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? What do you think is the key message of this dataviz project? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>

		<h3>Women's Pockets Are Inferior; The Pudding</h3>
		<p>The data in this project is from Jan Diehm and Amber Thomas with The Pudding, a self-described “digital publication that explains ideas debated in culture with visual essays.” It takes a look at how women’s pockets in jeans and pants are significantly smaller than men’s pockets, one of many gender inequities unfortunately evident today. The data is displayed visually through diagrams and graphs like small multiples, comparative illustrations of pockets by gender, and interactive tools and scrolling. As the user scrolls, information appears and contextualizes an illustrated diagram of the average male v. female jean pocket, highlighting men in yellow and women in red for a simple comparison. Later, data is represented as an illustrated comparison of male and female jean pockets by providing objects that can be clicked on to demonstrate the percentage of space each pocket provides for the same object (ex: 40% of an iPhone X fits into a woman’s pocket, while 100% of an iPhone X fits into a man’s pocket). These same interactive objects are then represented in small multiples, which show the dimensions of each object in the pockets of varying brands and styles, such as the Abercrombie Women’s Skinny Jean v. Abercrombie Men’s Skinny Jean. There are also hyperlinks interspersed with resources for readers to do further research into some of the reports used in these findings.</p>
		<p>I think that the key message of this dataviz project is to identify and deepen reader comprehension of why it is unfair for women’s pockets to be universally smaller than men’s, and the real problem it causes in a long string of continuing gender inequities. Some ways in which this dataviz project effectively conveyed this message are through the interactivity and diagrams. Everything was simplified so that it was very cut-and-dry which gender is at an advantage and which gender is at a disadvantage. As a reader, you didn’t have to really decipher anything-- All of the data was very visually clear and relied more on illustration than numbers, which is more universally understandable. Everything was designed and given to the reader at specific stages in the article, so there was really no need for the reader to go elsewhere for their information or stop scrolling, because information was given textually just a bit at a time and always contextualized with a graphic.</p>
		<p>I feel that this dataviz project was visceral because it was so illustrated. What I appreciated most about Mona Chalabi’s work when we analyzed it in class was how much attention she paid to keeping it simple. As I mentioned before, there was really nothing for the reader to figure out. Instead, it was pieced together for the reader visually-- the reader can see for themselves which pocket is bigger and what can fit inside. The argument itself is inherently visceral, because it uses all of the visual elements to explain that this is an issue of equality (and the lack thereof), as supported by the data. By comparing Mona Chalabi’s work to The Pudding’s piece, I think that illustrated dataviz is highly effective at communicating emotion and sticking with the reader. I won’t soon forget the image of a woman’s hand not fully fitting in her own pocket, while the man’s hand in his pocket had room for another.</p>



		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RZ235-x4KYuyA7xQX-flOP-N5uvweIMh9qPh4FN2fLo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">NY data</a>, Mapping The Gay Guide</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- Insert your iframe tag, with your embed code inside, here: -->
		<iframe title="LGBTQ+ community spaces in New York, 1965-1980]" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-1X8w7" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1X8w7/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="533"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>

  
  		
  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
